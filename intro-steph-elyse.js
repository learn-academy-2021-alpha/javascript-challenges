// Arithmetic Challenges

// Add 34 and 71
console.log(34 + 71)
// Subtract 67 from 123
console.log(123 - 67)
// Multiply 56 and 23
console.log(56 * 23)
// Divide 45 by 5
console.log(45 / 5)
// Calculate 5 to the power of 7
console.log(5 ** 7)
// Find the remainder of 33/6
console.log(33 % 6)
// String Challenges
console.log()


// Find the length of a string containing your name
console.log("Elyse".length)
// Does your string include the letter "e"?
console.log("Elyse".includes("e"))

// Boolean Challenges (return true or false)

// Is 34 divided by 3 greater than 67 divided by 2?
console.log(34 / 3 > 67 / 2)
// Does 5 evaluate to the same as "5"?
console.log(5 == "5")
// Does 5 strictly equal "5"?
console.log(5 === "5")
// Does !3 strictly equal 3?
console.log(!3 === 3)
// Does "LEARN".length strictly equal 5 AND "Student".length strictly equal 7?
console.log("LEARN".length === 5 && "Student".length === 7)
// Does "LEARN".length strictly equal 5 OR "Student".length strictly equal 10?

// Variables Challenges

// Set a variable called favNum equal to your favorite number
var favNum = 7
console.log(favNum)
// Log your favorite number divided by 2
console.log(favNum / 2)
// Set another variable called otherNum equal to 13
const otherNum = 13
console.log(otherNum)
// What is favNum divided by otherNum?
console.log(favNum / otherNum)
// Save a string as a variable
let ourString = "This is our string!"
console.log(ourString)
// Find the length of the string
console.log(ourString.length)
// Use the method charAt() to find what letter is at the 3rd index
console.log(ourString.charAt(3))

// Make sure you try different options and change the variables to ensure properly working code.

// Write an if/else statement that takes a variable of item and logs "in budget" if a price is $100 or less.
var price = 200
if(price <= 100){
    console.log("in budget")
}else{
    console.log("out of budget")
}

// Write an if/else statement that takes a variable of hungry and logs "eat food" if you are hungry and "keep coding" if you are not hungry.

// var hungry = ["yes", "no"]
// var randomMood = hungry[Math.floor(Math.random() * hungry.length)]

// if(randomMood == "yes"){
//     console.log("eat food")
// } else {
//     console.log("keep coding")
// }

// Write an if/else statement that takes a variable of trafficLight and logs "go" if the light is green, "slow down" if the light is yellow and "stop" if the light is red.

// Write an if/else statement that takes two variables of numbers and outputs the larger number, or logs equal if the numbers are the same.

// Write an if/else statement that takes a variable of a number and logs whether the number is odd, even, or zero.

// STRETCH Challenges

// Write an if/else statement that takes a variable of a grade percentage and logs the letter grade for that percentage, if the grade is 100% log "perfect score", if the grade is zero log "no grade available."

// Write an if/else statement that takes a variable of a boolean, number, or string datatype and logs the data type of the variable HINT: use the JS operator typeof.

// Create a password checker using a single if/else statement. If a user inputs a password with 12 or more characters AND the password includes !, then log "That is a mighty strong password!" If the userâ€™s password is 8 or more characters OR includes !, then log "That password is strong enough." Log "That is not a valid password." for every other input.
