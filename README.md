Unit 1 JavaScript Challenges

Note:
- Anything wrapped in < > is an indication that this will be named uniquely, the < > are NOT actually added to the command
- $ is an indication of a command line prompt, the $ is not included
- anything in ( ) is informational and not included in the command

Naming Conventions:
- Branch name: topic-student1-student2
- File name: topic-name.js

### Step By Step Process:

#### First Driver
- $ git clone <https://repo-from-github> (pasted from clipboard on GitHub)
- $ git checkout -b <topic-student1-student2> (ex. arrays-sarah-mina)
- create a new file inside the repo folder <topic-name.js>
- code!
- $ git status (this is an informational command that will help you avoid mistakes)
- $ git add .
- $ git commit -m "useful information here"
- $ git push origin <your-branch-name>


#### Second Driver
- $ git clone <https://repo-from-github> (pasted from clipboard on GitHub)
- $ git fetch
- $ git checkout -b <topic-student1-student2>
- code!
- $ git status (this is an informational command that will help you avoid mistakes)
- $ git add .
- $ git commit -m "useful information here"
- $ git push origin <your-branch-name>
  
  
#### Next Swap
- $ git pull origin <your-branch-name>
- code!
- $ git status (this is an informational command that will help you avoid mistakes)
- $ git add .
- $ git commit -m "useful information here"
- $ git push origin <your-branch-name>


#### Next Swap
(This is the same as the previous step)
- $ git pull origin <your-branch-name>
- code!
- $ git status (this is an informational command that will help you avoid mistakes)
- $ git add .
- $ git commit -m "useful information here"
- $ git push origin <your-branch-name>
