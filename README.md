# Javascript Challenges
**Unit 1 JavaScript Challenges**

### Note
- Anything wrapped in < > is an indication that this will be named uniquely, the < > are NOT actually added to the command
- $ is an indication of a command line prompt, the $ is not included
- anything in ( ) is informational and not included in the command

### Naming Conventions
- Branch name: topic-initial1-initial2 (ex. arrays-m-s)
- File name: topic-student1-student2.js (ex. arrays-mina-sarah.js)

### Step By Step Process:

#### First Driver
- $ git clone <https://github.com/repo-name-etc> (pasted from clipboard on GitHub)
- $ git checkout -b <topic-initial1-initial2> (ex. arrays-m-s)
- create a new file inside the repo folder <topic-student1-student2.js> (ex. arrays-mina-sarah.js)
- code!
- $ git status (this is an informational command that will help you avoid mistakes)
- $ git add .
- $ git commit -m "useful information here"
- $ git push origin <your-branch-name>


#### Second Driver
- $ git clone https://github.com/repo-name-etc> (pasted from clipboard on GitHub)
- $ git fetch --all
- $ git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
- code!
- $ git status (this is an informational command that will help you avoid mistakes)
- $ git add .
- $ git commit -m "useful information here"
- $ git push origin <your-branch-name>
  
  
#### Next Swap
- $ git pull origin <your-branch-name>
- code!
- $ git status (this is an informational command that will help you avoid mistakes)
- $ git add .
- $ git commit -m "useful information here"
- $ git push origin <your-branch-name>


#### Next Swap
(This is the same as the previous step)
- $ git pull origin <your-branch-name>
- code!
- $ git status (this is an informational command that will help you avoid mistakes)
- $ git add .
- $ git commit -m "useful information here"
- $ git push origin <your-branch-name>
